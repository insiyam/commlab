### Comic Name: “The Adventures of Professor S”

### Comic Link: [https://ahsen10s.github.io/interactive_comix_strip/](https://ahsen10s.github.io/interactive_comix_strip/)

### Comic Description:

Join Professor S as she travels through different dimensions and makes friends along the way!

### Initial Idea:

We wanted to create a story of a mad scientist with different visual dimensions, inspired by the movie Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse

### Process:

##### Stage 1: Deciding the story

We first had to decide on the story for our comic. After we had our initial idea we decided on the different dimensions Professor S would travel to. We decided on picking preexisting comic worlds so they would be easily recognizable to the viewer. Then we had to figure out the motivations of Professor S and the direction of our story. We decided to make it a bit corny and focus on friendships so that would be the Professor’s character growth in the comic.

##### Stage 2: Drawing the Panels

This was the stage I was most involved as I drew 3 of the panels for our project. This section took me significantly more time than expected since I wasn’t familiar with all the art styles. I started by trying to image trace my reference photos but this was mostly unsuccessful (with the exception of the pusheen cat) so I had to manually trace and and colour pick most of the art work. I also played around with composition to stray true to the original artwork.

##### Stage 3: Coding

I was not as involved in this process since I had already finished my share of the work earlier on in the process. I helped create the design and aesthetic of the arcade game interface, including making the buttons, and helped with the code to arrange the panel’s position.

### Reflection:

Overall, I am very happy with our project! I think our story and artwork feels very genuine and endearing! We had some struggles with the sound design so in the future I would like to improve on this.
