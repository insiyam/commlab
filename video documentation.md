### Project Description:

Listen to Alexa's recordings and figure out what happened!

### Initial Idea:

We wanted to create a story that unfolded as you listened to more audio snippets. I was inspired by how Alexa and other audio assistants can have surveillance audio evidence that could explain mysteries.

### Process:

##### Stage 1: Deciding the story

We first had to decide on the story for our audioscape. After we had our initial idea of using Alexa and the rough story line, we started to create a storyboard of different scenes that made the story clear but were also interesting to hear. We trie dto use different sound effects and sectioneed the audio to make a better flow.                           
       
##### Stage 2: Recording the Audios

I was the primary voice actor for my group so I had to record all the sounds of the main character. After the workshop, we rented all the items and I recorded my audio in a quiet lounge. I adapted the script we had written previously in my own words so it would sound more familiar to me and the acting would sound realistic. Although I had to reshoot some of the sections, I was haooy with how authentic the audio sounded and I think I portrayed the emotions pretty well.

##### Stage 3: Editing

I was not as involved in this process since I had already finished my share of the work earlier on in the process. Injoo edited the audioscape together and other members recorded the sound effects and lawywer section.

##### Stage 4: Coding

We chose to create a very simple website, as to not give away the mystery element of our story. We worked on this website during class time and created a minial but effective website.

### Reflection:

Overall, I am very happy with our project! Although simple, I think the work stands for itself and evokes emotions.
