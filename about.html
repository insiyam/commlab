                The 30 Minute Film Festival is a tradition of the Communications Lab course in the Interactive Media Department at NYUAD. On their first lab session, students recieve 30 minutes to shoot a film, and 30 minutes to edit it. They work in groups of four to make a minute-long film to showcase at the end of class. The genre or subjects of these films can be as vast or precise as the students wish. Different groups approach the prompt with unique ideas, highlighting their creativity. This website is a streaming platform for Section 001 taught by Professor Slavica Ceperkovic.
